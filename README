Reflexio is an attempt to create a language and virtual machine inspired by
Io (http://www.iolanguage.com/) and using the COLA object model from
http://piumarta.com/software/cola/

I have started this project in order to learn about dynamic, reflective
languages and virtual machines.
This project is not a fork of Io and does not intend to replace it.
